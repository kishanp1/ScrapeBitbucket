# ScrapeBitbucket
Hello fellow CS enthusiasts,

As you can tell by the title, this script is going to scrape your bitbucket account and make stuff easy and automatic for you.

Make sure to install:
Python
import requests (pip install requests if it does not work)
import git (similar, pip install git)
and of course a bit bucket account.

Features of the script:
It is going to download your/shared repositories from your bitBucket.

I have developed this as one of the most important stuff TAs do is to grade projects, now we know it is kind of tough to share and repositories and keep track of them on gitHub, so I used BitBucket for my class(TA for Computer Architecture and Organization) to make them share their projects with us. As a class of almost 100, they all share their coding projects with me, with a specific name format(very important) and with the use of this script, I automatically download all of them at once.

P.S: Make sure you do not already have the same named projects in your local folder, the script will fail.
